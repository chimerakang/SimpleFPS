# Simple FPS

# Features!

  - Fully commented source code!
  - A networked weapon system with several weapons and easy flexibilty
  - A few more things
  - MIT license! *(However, don't be afraid to credit/thank me, I would appriciate it!)*
___
The project includes some nice things, however, an example project would be too big and complex if I had to feature every thing Forge has to offer, so here is a list of things this project does **not** feature.
 - Master server registration. This is very easy to setup with Forge though.
 - NAT Punchthrough server. Forge offers a natpunch which I'm not using for this project.
 - Server browser. This project is direct connect only, however Forge comes with examples of both a lobby system and a server browser.
 - An actual gamemode, however everything you need for creating your own is there (A gamemode class)
 - Any sounds at all :(
 - No options menu! The game is using some post processing that you can't turn off ingame. If you computer is struggeling to run this, disable it on the player's camera.

Simple FPS was a project designed to show off how certain things are done in Forge Remastered, showcased as a fully featured game since I figured that's the best way to example stuff.

# Usage

Simple FPS is made with ~~Unity 2018.4.14f1~~ 
It should work on other Unity installations, try it out.
Just open up the project in Unity, open the /Scenes/MainMenu and press play, and you are good to go.
If you want to build it, make sure you make the main menu the first scene and the ArenaScene the second scene in the build menu. 

**There is also a compiled build included for Windows, if you just wanna have a quick test run**
